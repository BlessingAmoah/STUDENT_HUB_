Student Hub

Student hub serves as a tool for collaborative learning and project work, as well as a platform for sharing experiences related to internships, summer plans and student organizations. The user will be able to post information about their classes, projects that they are interested in or working on and other users  with the same interests can comment on such posts to collaborate or give feedback. The user would be able to create an account using their .edu emails only.
