Intern Manager: [Mustafa Sadriwala]
Intern Director: [Name]
Peer(s): [Brittany, Thanh]
GitHub Repository Link: [https://github.com/Meta-U-2024]
Overview
[Provide a brief description of what your project is about and what problems it aims to solve.]
Category: [Student Hub]
Story: [Student hub serves as a tool for collaborative learning and project work, as well as a platform for sharing experiences related to internships, summer plans and student organizations. The user will be able to post information about their classes, projects that they are interested in or working on and other users  with the same interests can comment on such posts to collaborate or give feedback. The user would be able to create an account using their .edu emails only.]
Market: [The target audience are students.]
Habit: [This app will be used daily by students as a way to connect with other students in different schools.]
Scope: [The initial scope of this app will focus on collaborating with others by sharing information, making a post and mentorship program. In the future it will be expanded to include additional features but will not add functionality like event planning.]

Product Spec
Based on the app description, this section goes into more detail about what the app should do, and what functionalities it must provide to the users.

As the Educational system differs from one school to another, students enrolled in the same curriculum most of the time, experience variation in how the courses are taught. This inconsistency limits opportunities for students to connect, discuss their learning experiences, prepare for internships, and plan for graduate school. The student hub web app is designed to bridge the gap by helping students connect, share ideas, and learn together. There will be a restriction to students without an educational email address, ensuring a focused and secure community. The goal is to connect students with the opportunity with their peers in the same academic path or those interested in transferring schools. 
User Stories
User stories are actions that the user should be able to perform in your app.

User Role: A student who is seeking for opportunities and connecting with peers with the same interests: 
The user  can create an account and log in with their .edu account only
The user can also edit his or her profile
The user can sort between the course that is relevant to his or her interest.
The user will be able to see mentors available and sort them out according to their career goals.
The user can make a  post and also comment on a post of others. 
The user can like a post. 


First, focus and identify functionality that is required for your MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that conforms to all the project requirements and expectations. Make sure your technical challenges are part of your MVP.

You should also identify optional / nice-to-have functionalities that would be done as stretch goals during MU Week 8 and 9. Remember, technical challenges should not be optional features, they must be code complete before the end of Week 8!
Required
Small example for Facebook app:
User can login
User can create an account
User can create / edit / delete posts
User can view a feed of posts
User can add / remove other users as friends
User can like posts
User can see their profile
Optional
User can create multi-media (photos, videos) posts
User can see notifications of actions made by their friends
User can edit their profile information
User can see their friends’ profile
User can comment on posts
User passwords are encrypted in the database for security
Screen Archetypes

[Describe the different screens that, together, compose the full experience of your app. You can leverage anything you want, such as diagrams and mocks.]

[Using diagrams you can also describe how navigation and presentation of these screens will work on a high-level.]

[These are just high-level representations though. Don’t spend too much time building mocks.]

Data Model
[Describe the data you’re going to need to back your application. This can include database models (like tables), or external data you’ll require from some API.]

Server Endpoints
[Describe the endpoints that your application is going to consume from your server. If you’re using REST, then you’ll probably want to include the method (GET/POST/etc) and the expected parameters (query parameters, body parameters, etc.)]
Navigation

Project Requirements
[Based on the Project Guide, describe how your project is going to be fulfilling each of the base project requirements.]

Technical Challenges
For your project, you should demonstrate that you can apply what you’ve learned so far and expand on that knowledge to write code and implement features that go beyond the scope of the projects you worked on during CodePath.

Based on the general idea and direction of your project requirements, your intern manager will create at least two (2) Technical Challenges for you. This section is all about explaining what they are and how you’re planning to tackle them - you’ll work together with your manager to fill it out. 

Technical Challenge #1 - [Name/Small Description]
What
What problem are you solving, and what parts go beyond what you learned in CodePath? 
How
Explain in words how you’ll solve this problem. 

You’re encouraged to expand on this section with pseudo-code, links to external frameworks, architecture / design diagrams, anything that you can use to explain this to others!
Technical Challenge #2
What
How

Database Integration
[Describe what you are using for database storage. For example, Parse, MongoDB, Sequelize, etc.]

External APIs
[Describe at least one external API you’re using for your project. For example, Google Maps, Spoonacular, OpenWeather, etc.]

Authentication
[Describe how user authentication is handled for your project, including logging in and signing up. Also describe any kind of cookie / session management you’re doing and how you’re implementing it, and how this affects navigation between different screens by the same user.]

Visuals and Interactions
[Provide details on how your app is fulfilling the following UI craft requirements, and how these are technically accomplished.]

Interesting Cursor Interaction
UI Component with Custom Visual Styling
Loading State

Timeline
Project execution will start in Week 4 of MU. Based on the previously defined requirements, user stories and technical challenges, use the following table to scope out and plan a timeline for deliverables over Week 4 - 9. You can be as detailed as you need, ranging from simply mentioning the user stories, or dividing them into sub-tasks.

You are free to modify the table, add / remove rows or columns, whatever fits your style! The important thing here is that you focus and prioritize certain aspects of your project so you don’t get behind and are ready to deliver the MVP - remember your required features should be code complete before the end of Week 8, including both technical challenges!

We also encourage you to leverage project tracking tools such as GitHub Issues or Meta’s internal Tasks / GSD tooling to keep manage individual units of work.

1
Focus on the components that will serve as the skeleton of your project. You will probably be using most of what you learned in CodePath to set up things like the client and server repositories, initial routing, login / registration, creating a database with object models, etc.
Example:
User can login
User can create an account
[Optional] User passwords are encrypted in the database for security

2
Week 5 and 6 should be where you focus on the specific requirements of your project.
Example:
User can create / edit / delete posts
User can chat with other users in real-time (e.g. technical challenge)

By this point, you should be getting started with your technical challenges as well.


7
4
You should focus on finishing your MVP and core requirements. By this point, you should be done with at least one of your technical challenges.


8
5
Continue work on finishing touches and stretch goals for your MVP. By this point, your core functionality and both TAPs should all be in place. It is also a good point to start working on stretch goals that could further expand on the functionality (and technical complexity) of your project.

This week you also have to submit your self-review, make sure you allocate enough time for this alongside your final submission for your project!


9
6
It’s time to show others what you have built! Work on a presentation and demo that you will present to other interns to showcase your work. You are also free to continue polishing and expanding on your project!
